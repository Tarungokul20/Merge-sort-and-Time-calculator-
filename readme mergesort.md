# ðŸ§® Merge Sort (Python)

An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python.

## Features

- Recursively splits the list into halves
- Merges them back in sorted order
- Works with any list of comparable elements

## How It Works

- **Divide** the list into two halves
- **Recursively** sort each half
- **Merge** the sorted halves together

Example:
python
merge_sort([6, 2, 7, 4, 1])
# Output: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
